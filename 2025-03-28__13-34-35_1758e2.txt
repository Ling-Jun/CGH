Assessment criteria
What makes a competitive application
The Challenge Fund is a competitive program. We evaluate all projects based on merit. Project merit is based on:
GHG emissions reductions
net-zero alignment, and
co-benefits (environmental, social, or technical)
Considerations that influence project recommendation:
being evaluated as high risk
not aligning with net-zero goals
projects may be recommended for funding to help represent Canada’s regions
other factors may also impact project recommendations (such as organization type)
Cost-effectiveness
LCEF cost-effectiveness is the ratio of LCEF funding requested, per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) reduced in 2030. Under the Challenge 2023 intake, the project types that were most cost-effective include:
waste diversion
biomass retrofits
industrial retrofits
anaerobic digesters
waste heat recovery
HVAC system retrofits
carbon capture and utilization
district energy system upgrades
