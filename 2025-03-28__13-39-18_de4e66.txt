Call for proposals closed November 23, 2022.
The biomass supply chain component of the Clean Fuels Fund will ensure a steady and usable supply of sustainable feedstock is available to clean fuel production facilities across the country. It will support the establishment of regional hubs to gather feedstock from diverse sources and locations.
Program benefits
By supporting domestic biomass feedstock infrastructure projects, we  can:
advance the collection, supply, and  distribution of biomass materials
minimize feedstock supply risks
enable access to stranded or underused biomass  resources
seek to increase the economically viable  biomass supply radius
Establishing sustainable supply chains will benefit farmers, forest harvest operators, saw mills, and municipal waste services by opening up new opportunities and markets for feedstocks that align with Type 2 in the
Clean Fuels Regulations
for producing advanced clean fuels.
