Eligible activities
On the innovation continuum, the program starts at the "technology demonstration" phase through to the "technology adoption" phase.
The innovation continuum
Description of image above
The innovation continuum consists of 5 phases:
Basic and applied research
Prototype development
Technology demonstration
Commercialization of technology
Technology adoption
Your activity(ies) are of the following nature and type:
Commercialization of innovative agricultural, agri-food or agri-based technologies or processes
Demonstration of innovative agricultural, agri-food or agri-based technologies or processes where all necessary testing and piloting has been completed and the innovation is ready for you to commercialize. The demonstration must involve one or more of the following:
Production of samples for market validation
Creation of a reference or showcase site for pre-commercial demonstration
Adoption of commercially ready innovative technologies or processes to the applicant's agriculture or agri-food operations
Examples of eligible activities include:
Commercialization of innovative bio-based plastics and other synthetics as an alternative food packaging material that is new to Canada and provides significant benefits over other bio-based plastics
Building a new facility to commercialize a new and significant technique to produce alternative protein or other food products
Commercialization of "new to the ag sector" meat cutting technologies or processes that provide significant benefits over established meat cutting options
Significant adaptation of robotics equipment used in non-agriculture related sectors to agricultural based situation, such as vertical farm
Demonstration of a new and significant artificial intelligence technology platform to assist growing or food processing operations
Significant adaptation of a commercially ready controlled environment agricultural system to a northern climate and/or remote areas that improves its sustainability and cost-effectiveness
Important note: Definitions
The program defines "innovation" as the:
creation or demonstration of a technology or process that is expected to produce improvements over other competing technologies or processes available to the Canadian agricultural or agri-food sector.
adoption of commercially available technologies or processes to address a deficiency facing the agricultural or agri-food sector. The technology or process needs to:
be new to the modern Canadian agricultural or agri-food sector
be not yet widely adopted in other countries
undergo significant adaptation or customization
The program defines “adaptation” as the modification of a technology or process, by the applicant, to a new use or purpose for which it was not originally designed (for example, modification of equipment for use in non-agricultural applications to agricultural applications).
The program defines “customization” as the modification of a technology or process that is being used for its intended purpose to suit the specific requirements or specifications of an applicant (for example, modifications of purchased equipment needed to produce a food product in a way that is not permitted by the design characteristics of the equipment).
