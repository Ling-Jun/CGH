Implementation Readiness Fund
The Implementation Readiness Fund is a program under the Low Carbon Economy Fund (LCEF) that supports the Government of Canada’s commitment in the
2030 Emissions Reduction Plan
. This fund aims to remove barriers for organizations and communities across Canada to adopt low-carbon technologies. It also aligns with Canada’s mitigation efforts to meet its 2030 climate objectives.
Projects funded through the program will focus on workforce and development training, network development and knowledge sharing across sectors. Recipients will organize workshops and training opportunities for targeted industries and communities to find solutions to increase the adoption of low-carbon technologies.

Canadian Coalition for Green Health Care
Project title: Preparing Canada’s health care buildings for net-zero
Through this project, the Canadian Coalition for Green Health Care is working with healthcare workers and health sector associations to accelerate the reduce GHG emissions from health care facilities such as hospitals, health care centres, clinics and long-term care homes.
The project is active until March 2027.
Canadian Water Network
Project title: Charting the course to #Netzero water: Mobilizing Canada’s municipal water network for greenhouse gas mitigation in the public water sector.
This project is helping the Canadian Water Network’s current network of water partners and associations to adopt approaches and technology to reduce GHG emissions from the water, wastewater and stormwater services sectors.
The project is active until March 2027.
Climate Challenge Network
Project title: Greening Health Care – practical pathways to decarbonization of hospital facilities.
This project is expanding and enhancing the existing Greening Health Care program to increase deep energy and emissions reductions in hospitals across Canada. The Climate Challenge Network is working to identify and address barriers, to share hospital-specific best practices and to deliver technical support to accelerate energy savings and build capacity in the hospital network.
The project is active until February 2027.
Community Energy Cooperative Canada
Project title: Renewable Energy Co-operative Enhancement Initiative
The project aims to support knowledge sharing and networking activities for the renewable energy co-operative (REC) sector across Canada, thus enhancing the sector’s contribution to the reduction of GHG emissions. The project will develop knowledge sharing and training activities such as webinars, organize annual forums and networking events to boost cooperation and impact, and develop a centralized digital repository of resources to empower the REC sector with data and resources for decision-making and engagement.
This project is active until August 2027.
Council of Sustainable Industries
Project title: Canada in mode net-zero carbon 2030 – Workforce and network development.
The Council of Sustainable Industries is hosting training sessions and helping small and medium-sized businesses develop partnerships so they can more easily prepare, develop and implement  their own GHG emissions reductions initiatives.
The project is active until March 2027.
Environmental Careers Organization of Canada – Project I
Project title: IGNITE: Innovating GHG-Reduction, Nurturing Institutions, and Training Enterprises for Low Carbon Economy.
The project is helping build human and institutional resources among small and medium-sized businesses to help them participate in GHG emission reduction projects across Canada. Activities include content development, training and capacity building with selected businesses.
The project is active until February 2027.

The project is active until March 2027.
Métis National Council
Project title: The MNC connect program and Youth Climate summit
This project is delivering clean energy workshops to give Métis energy professionals and youth tools and capacity to develop clean and sustainable energy solutions for their communities. This project also supported a Youth Council Summit in April 2024 that increased opportunities for networking and knowledge sharing through sessions on clean and renewable energy, energy transition and Métis entrepreneurship.
The project is active until March 2025.
Saskatchewan Health Authority
Project title: Saskatchewan Health Authority Energy Assessments and Training
Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) aims to evaluate and enhance SHA facilities to accelerate action in the adoption of approaches and technology to reduce GHG emissions. This project will span three fiscal years (2024-2025 – 2026-27). It will systematically implement training and collaborate with a national engineering firm to conduct energy assessments at hospitals, clinics, and administrative buildings distributed across Saskatchewan’s healthcare sector.
This project is active until January 2027.
Sustainable Waterloo Region
Project title: Supporting the Development of a Network of Green Building Professionals in Waterloo Region and Beyond
This project aims to provide organizations and individuals working in the development industry with the skills that are required to build and retrofit buildings to net-zero or near net-zero standards, with a focus in Waterloo region and surrounding areas in Ontario. The Sustainable Waterloo Region will: develop and deliver curriculum through consultation with subject area experts; convene a network of building industry professionals and provide ongoing connection opportunities for best practice sharing and collaboration; and develop resources such as case studies, best practice guides, and templates for member use in their building projects.
This project is active until May 2027.
