Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund
The Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund provides funding directly to provinces and territories. It helps them reduce carbon pollution and meet Canada’s 2030 climate target. This funding also supports our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. Each province and territory focuses on the best way to deliver the funding available to reduce emissions given their unique climates and circumstances.
Overview
Each province and territory is allocated a funding envelope under the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund to support climate action priorities.
Eligible activity categories to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promote sustainability include energy efficiency, fuel switching and non-energy related actions.
Examples of eligible activity types include:
equipment retrofits for energy efficiency and fuel switching
organics diversion
industrial process emissions changes
industrial product use changes
These activities contribute to sustainable practices and emissions reductions across sectors.
