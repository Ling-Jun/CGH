About the program
Mitacs Accelerate creates dynamic collaborations that partner for-profit and not-for-profit organizations with Canada’s brightest academic minds. This research award provides matched funding of $15,000 CAD per four- or six-month internship, where interns will work collaboratively with their academic supervisor and partner organization on a research project.
The Accelerate program aims to:
Help businesses optimize their budgets, grow their R&D and tap into the expertise of highly skilled students, graduate students, recent grads and post-docs to solve your research challenges.
Help students broaden their professional networks, tap into funding opportunities, and gain invaluable hands-on experience at for-profit and not-for-profit partner organizations seeking skilled research talent.
Help professors build game-changing research partnerships with industry leaders, tap into flexible funding, and help drive the innovation of tomorrow.
Funding
Our standard funding model requires a partner contribution starting at $7,500 CAD per internship (4 or 6 months) which results in a $15,000 CAD research award. Of this award, the intern must receive a minimum $10,000 CAD stipend or salary.
Our Postdoctoral researcher funding model requires a contribution of $10,000 CAD per internship (4 months) which results in a $20,000 CAD research award. This funding model is only available to postdoctoral interns.

FAQs
Before You Apply
When You Apply
After You Apply
During Your Internship
$20k model: Can the 20K units be used for postdocs in Accelerate Entrepreneur, joint applications with NSERC or SSHRC, etc?
Yes, $20k units will be available for all new postdoc submissions in Accelerate, including eAcc and joint applications.
$20k model: Can we do 6-month units for $20k?
No. The $20k model is designed to enable a higher annual salary for postdocs, comparable with other postdoc funding in Canada, by providing $20k per 4-month internship. If a lower funding amount is desired, use the $15k funding model.
$20k model: For the $20k postdoc option in Accelerate, can I still allocate $5k to research expenses?
Yes, for each $20K IU, up to $5k can be allocated to research expenses.
$20k model: I am a postdoc currently on a $15k Accelerate, or I am a professor with a recently approved Accelerate project for a postdoc. Can I change to the $20k funding model?
The $20k funding model in Accelerate is available for PDFs on new applications, but approved internships will not change. The $20k funding model was previously available through Elevate, so it is not a net-new offering, and already-submitted Accelerate applications will not change.
$20k model: I am a recent grad (post-PhD) but not a postdoc, can I access the $20k model?
No, this funding model is reserved for interns with postdoc status, just as Elevate was.
$20k model: If a postdoc is replaced with a PhD intern (or any other level), can they keep the $20k funding model?
No. The $20k model will only be available for postdocs. If a postdoc is replaced with another level intern, the budget will need to be changed to the standard $15k Accelerate funding model.
Are Recent Graduates eligible?
Recent college and university graduates (any level) are eligible, at the discretion of the academic institution.
Must have status at a Canadian academic institution
Check with your institution to find out what status(es) are available for recent grads
Internship must start within two years of graduation
Normally eligible for one 4-6-month internship but may do up to three depending on the needs of the project and the discretion of the academic institution
All program expectations remain the same: the intern must have an academic supervisor and split their time between the academic institution and the partner organization
Recent Graduates are eligible for standard Accelerate and Accelerate Entrepreneur
International travel may be limited by circumstances external to Mitacs for some individuals (e.g., recent graduates may not be able to travel internationally for the project due to visa requirements for non-students).
Can a partner organization contribute more than $7,500 per internship?
Yes. Partner organizations are welcome to contribute additional funding but Mitacs will not provide any additional funding outside of the standard award. [This additional partner funding should be included in the application budget and the anticipated use of funds (e.g., stipend/salary top-up, specialized equipment).] Top-up funds must be received at Mitacs at the same time as the minimum contribution and will be added to the award and forwarded to the academic institution.
Can I hold both an Accelerate and other grants at the same time?
Mitacs does not have any restrictions on its recipients holding other grants.
You are responsible to determine if your other grants have such restrictions prior to applying to Accelerate.
Can Mitacs allow for virtual interaction with partner organizations and academic institutions?
Direct interaction and supervision by the partner organization for a portion of the internship is a key feature of Mitacs’s Accelerate and BSI programs. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mitacs required that interns spend time on site at the partner organization to benefit from this interaction and supervision. Now that the technology to enable virtual work has greatly improved and many workplaces have hybrid or fully virtual operations, Mitacs will continue to allow interaction with the partner organization in our internship programs to take place virtually as well as in person.
When writing their application, participants should focus on the nature of the interaction with the partner and plan for high-quality interaction and supervision regardless of whether it takes place in person, virtually or hybrid. Mitacs still encourages on-site interaction at the partner when it is logistically feasible.
* Note that Globalink are international mobility programs. For this reason, travel and time spent on site with collaborators are still required in these programs.
Load More
If an Accelerate internship has been approved, when will the funds be available?
Mitacs forwards Accelerate funds to the student’s academic institution only after it has received the contribution from the student’s partner organization. Please allow two weeks for processing upon receipt of this contribution. Interns travelling to Canada should be aware that their funding may not be available until they arrive in Canada. Mitacs recommends that interns contact their Canadian host institution’s Office of Research Services prior to the project to determine when they can access funds.
$20k model: Can postdocs still use the $15k model or are they required to use the $20k model?
$20k will be the default for postdocs in Mitacs Plus, but both $20k and $15k will be available.
Can a student do an Accelerate internship outside of Canada?
All Accelerate internships must include a partner organization in Canada (for-profit or not-for-profit corporation,
hospital
or municipality) and may optionally include a partner organization(s) abroad. Interns must have student, postdoc or recent
grad
status at an eligible Canadian post-secondary institution and must interaction with the Canadian partner organization. If applicable, they may also travel to interact with an international partner organization
.
When must the partner contribution be received at Mitacs?
Invoices must be paid in full to Mitacs prior to any internship funds being sent by Mitacs to the university. Please note that all partner funds must be sent directly to Mitacs and not to the university. The funds must be received in advance of the internship start date.
Can I extend my project?
Certain requirements must be met to be eligible to request a project extension. Please see the criteria below and contact your Mitacs Advisor for next steps. If your case does not meet the criteria below, you may submit a new project funding application.
1. Applicants who have an approved Mitacs Accelerate project may apply for a funding extension of 1 internship unit (IU) per intern — to a maximum of 10 IUs per project. Applications for an extension can be submitted once the internship(s) being extended is/are at least 75% through their original timeline. The funding extension shall be used to:
• Complete the existing project in cases where the project has experienced delays due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., lack of access to facilities due to COVID-19, sample delays due to transportation, seasonal delays in fieldwork, etc.)
• Broaden the scope of the project (e.g., conducting additional tests, including additional samples, adding data sources for analysis, etc.)
• In either case, the request cannot be used to add new objectives or change existing project objectives.
2. Extensions must be requested within 4 months from when the intern completed their last IU on the project. In cases where a new intern is being added to the project, the request must be submitted within 4 months from the end of the last IU completed on the project.
3. If the extensions will be used to add a new intern to the project, a New Intern Profile form and the new intern’s CV will be required along with this completed form.
4. All interns must remain eligible (including respecting maximum internship allocation) to hold Mitacs internships for the duration of the extension period.
5. No discounts or enhanced leveraging options are available to fund the extension internships. Only standard funding models may apply, regardless of the funding models for the original project. Partner organizations are required to contribute additional funds for the extension period.
What happens if a project needs to be cancelled?
Mitacs Accelerate internships require the active participation of the intern, professor, and partner organization. All participants should attempt to fulfill their project obligations.If all parties are in agreement, a project or individual internship may be terminated. If one party wants to cancel the internship without other parties’ agreement, they must first notify them in writing and allow 30 days for resolution of outstanding issues.
Any funds remaining after a cancelled internship must be returned to Mitacs. For more information, please refer to the downloadable General Mitacs Terms, Conditions & Policies zip file found under How To Apply.
What if it’s been more than 30 days and the invitation for the Exit Survey has not been received?
Participants should check their spam or junk folder. If they still haven’t received it, they should contact evaluation@mitacs.ca.
What is the Mid-Term survey?
The Mid-Term surveys are mid-term checks that are sent to Accelerate Interns at the midpoint of each internship unit on the project, to check-in and ensure that the internship started as originally proposed, to address any issues, and to offer an opportunity for stakeholders to provide feedback to the Accelerate team during the internship.
When will the link to complete the Exit Survey be provided?
Participants should receive an invitation within the 30 days following the completion of their internship/fellowship.
