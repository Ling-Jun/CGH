Since 1944, Export Development Canada (EDC) has been an expert in international trade. We manage and take on risk, making it safer for Canadian businesses to grow beyond our borders. Our unique suite of financial solutions can help you offset the risks of doing business abroad, finance your deal, and access the working capital you need.
Manage risk
Our tools and expertise protect your reputation and bottom line. Our risk-management solutions help safeguard your cash flow, ensure you get paid and avoid commercial and political risk consequences.
Secure financing
Offer competitive payment terms, get direct financing for key deals or gain an experienced partner in EDC for financing high-value, high-stakes international projects.
Grow working capital
Our bonding and guarantee support provides breathing room to pursue opportunities without depleting your precious working capital.
We’ve been helping Canadian businesses of all sizes along their export journey, getting them to accelerate their growth by turning uncertainty into opportunity.
Risk management solutions
Credit Insurance
Credit insurance protects you in the event of non-payment by your customers. It helps you access more cash through your bank and allows you to offer competitive payment terms to customers.
Performance Security Insurance
Working with a new customer in another country for the first time can expose many unknowns. We help you manage the risk of a buyer calling a guarantee due to specific commercial and political risks.

Financing solutions
Buyer Financing
Give your business a competitive edge by offering appealing payment terms and easing the pressure of up-front payments. We can extend loans to your customer, covering their purchases from you so you don’t have to take on excess risk.
Direct Lending
With our high tolerance for risk, our financing can support you to go after and deliver on international opportunities. Expand your global footprint, take on more international projects or cover your work-in-progress costs.
Structured and Project Finance
If you have a long-term, capital-intensive international project to finance, our expert team can provide experienced advice, financing arrangements and underwriting services to position you for success.
Investment Matching Program
Get quick access to reliable capital so you can put your growth plans into action. We work with venture capital and private equity investors under their commercial terms to match investments of up to $5 million.
Inclusive Trade Investments Program
If your Canadian exporting business is owned or led by people identifying as women, Indigenous, Black and other dimensions of diversity, our program can provide equity capital to support your growth plans in global markets.
Working capital solutions
Export Guarantee Program
Whether you need working capital, financing to expand your export business or cash to set up a foreign affiliate, we can help grow your borrowing capacity. By offering your financial institution a guarantee of repayment, we make it easier to access the money you require to move forward.
Foreign Exchange Facility Guarantee
Fluctuating exchange rates keep many exporters up at night — and so do the collateral requirements that go along with hedging foreign exchange. With our guarantee in place, you can avoid posting collateral to your foreign exchange contract provider.
Account Performance Security Guarantee
Protect your cash flow by having the guarantees your customers need issued without having to put up cash or credit to the issuer as collateral. With our support, you get the benefit of pre-approval and a predictable rate for your guarantees, making it easier to go after opportunities when they arise.
Surety bonds
Give your surety bond provider the confidence to give you the fullest possible coverage.
