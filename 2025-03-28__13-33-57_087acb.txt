Overview
The Climate Action and Awareness Fund (CAAF) is investing up to $206 million over five years to support Canadian-made projects that help to reduce Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions.
The CAAF is designed to support projects that can create middle class jobs for Canadians who work in science and technology, academia, and at the grassroots community level. These projects are critical as we continue to build a sustainable net-zero emissions economy by 2050.
Three main priorities
The Climate Action and Awareness Fund has three main priorities:
support youth climate awareness (call for proposals closed summer 2020) and community-based climate action (1
st
call for proposals closed fall 2020; 2
nd
directed call for proposals closed winter 2022)
support climate research at Canadian think tanks and in academia (call for proposals closed summer 2022)
advancing climate change science and technology (call for proposals closed spring 2021)
Funding sources
The CAAF was created with contributions from the Climate Action Fund, as well as a significant investment from the Environmental Damages Fund (EDF).
The EDF provides a mechanism for directing funds received from fines, court orders, and voluntary payments to priority projects that will benefit Canada’s natural environment. The EDF helps to ensure that environmental good follows environmental harm by supporting projects with measurable outcomes in Canadian communities.
Available funds
There are currently no funds available.
